* Conducted a comprehensive data analysis and visualization project, exploring a fuel efficiency dataset for 398 cars using Python, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
* Employed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis techniques to derive insights and answer seven research questions pertaining to fuel efficiency and performance.
* Analyzed the contribution of multiple factors, such as origin, number of cylinders, weight, and horsepower, to
fuel efficiency and performance, and uncovered nonlinear relationships and trade-offs between these factors.
* Discovered that Japanese cars have the highest median mpg and concentration of high mpg values and observed a steady increase in average mpg since the 1970s due to stricter fuel efficiency standards and
technological advancements.
* Concluded that, as horsepower and weight increase, acceleration tends to decrease, with heavier cars
requiring more power and engines with higher horsepower being heavier.
* Demonstrated the ability to apply advanced data analysis and visualization techniques as part of a data
analysis and visualization coursework
